 Brief 

 For this assignment I was meant to find code that has inspired me or that I want to learn. The instructions were to Create a GitHub repository, add your software research into the 'Code' tab of your GitHub repository, Add comments.  

 Research and exploration 

 From the beginning I have wanted to learn javascript and React as I find creating apps and websites fun and creative. I decided to investigate react a bit more and thought of creating a todo list as my first project, as I continued trying to understand react I realised that it's too big of a leap for me personally and that's when I found the inspiration to learn javascript so I could work on my goal to learn React. Javascript is a great first step in this process as you need to know at least the fundamentals of javascript before learning React since it's a javascript framework. I decided to continue the project and instead of doing it in React, to just do it in javascript.

 Analysis and Evaluation 

A major aspect of the code I believe should be changed is the way it is structured. The perfect thing to do is to create separate folders for each coding language and connect them to the main html file with a src link. This will improve readability and further adaptability and maintainability. The code itself works great and is simple and user friendly, but I believe it could have a few changes to it. The changes I would make are the colors and the design, I would like to implement a way for each item on the list to be a different color when added and when an item on the list is clicked it is removed rather than crossed off.  

My code 

For my code I submitted a project I created a few months ago that I felt could’ve been developed better. Although I believe it was decent for my first website and my first time coding, I believe I could improve on many factors of the website such as the look/ style, maybe I could have added some more JavaScript and truly created a functional website. Something I should have done and didn’t think about is file organisation when it comes to coding, in the future I will organise images and videos into a separate folder from the code since it’s very chaotic looking for the files. Also, I will use references from other sources rather than having no creative inspiration.
