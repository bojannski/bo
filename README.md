 Brief 

 For this assignment I was meant to find code that has inspired me or that I want to learn. The instructions were to Create a GitHub repo, add your software research into the 'Code' tab of your GitHub repository, Add comments.  

 Research and exploration 

 From the beginning I have wanted to learn javascript and React as I find creating apps and websites fun and creative. I decided to investigate react a bit more and thought of creating a todo list as my first project, as I continued trying to understand react I realised that it's too big of a leap for me personally and that's when I found the inspiration to learn javascript so I could work on my goal to learn React. Javascript is a great first step in this process as you need to know at least the fundamentals of javascript before learning React since it's a javascript framework. I decided to continue the project and instead of doing it in React, to just do it in javascript.
